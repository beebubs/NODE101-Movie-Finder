# NODE101-Movie-Finder-Data


In this project I: 
1. Created a server using the Express framework
2. Logged all incoming requests with the morgan logging library
3. Created an .env file to store my API key
4. Accepted requests for the Open Movie DataBase (OMDB) API
5. Made the requests to the OMDB using the axios library
6. Cached, or stored, the responses for subsequent requests
7. Ensured the data is updated at least once a day
